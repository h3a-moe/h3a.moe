      <p>Dear Valued Customers,</p>

      <p>We wish to inform you that, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to restrict access to our service for users located in some countries. This decision is motivated by a commitment to ensuring compliance with international regulations and sanctions, specifically those administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), including the Entity List.</p>

      <p>One of our primary responsibility is to maintain the highest standards of legal and regulatory compliance. We have observed an increasing need for vigilance in the context of sanctions compliance, given the evolving international landscape. It is essential that we take proactive steps to mitigate any potential risks associated with unauthorized use of our software that may lead to violations of BIS sanctions, particularly those related to the Entity List.</p>

      <p>While we deeply value our global user base and seek to maintain an inclusive approach, <strong>we believe that restricting access to our service from these users is a necessary measure to eliminate any possibility of our software being utilized for activities that may contravene international sanctions.</strong> We want to emphasize that this decision is driven by our commitment to upholding international regulations and promoting responsible use of technology.</p>

      <p>We understand that this may have implications for our users, and we are committed to providing support and guidance to help them transition during this period. We appreciate your understanding and support as we navigate these complex compliance matters. We remain committed to ensuring the integrity of our software and services, while also adhering to international sanctions.</p>
