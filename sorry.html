      <p>Dear Valued Customers,</p>

      <p>We regret to inform you that we are unable to provide our services to customers in certain countries due to compliance requirements, particularly with regards to international sanctions.</p>

      <p>International sanctions are regulations imposed by governments in response to activities deemed harmful to international peace and security. These sanctions restrict certain activities and transactions with individuals, organizations, or countries that are subject to sanctions. As a result, we are unable to provide our services to customers in countries that are subject to these restrictions.</p>

      <p>We understand that this may be disappointing news for our customers in affected countries. However, as a business, we must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this includes international sanctions.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
    </code>
